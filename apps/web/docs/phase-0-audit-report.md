# Phase 0 Audit Report

## Executive Summary

**Critical Finding**: Phase 0 is NOT fully functional. While the frontend components exist, most backend API endpoints are broken, preventing proper data display.

## Audit Results

### ‚úÖ Working Components

1. **Frontend UI Components**
   - Leaderboard view renders correctly
   - Player profile page exists but shows no data
   - Game history page exists but shows no data
   - Stats page exists but shows no data
   - PWA installation prompt displays
   - Mobile navigation works

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/leaderboard` - ‚úÖ WORKING (returns player ratings)
   - Local API proxy correctly forwards to Python backend

### ‚ùå Broken Components

1. **Backend API Endpoints**
   - `/players/{id}` - ‚ùå ERROR: "column current_leaderboard.player_name does not exist"
   - `/games` - ‚ùå ERROR: "Could not find relationship between 'games' and 'game_scores'"
   - `/stats/season` - ‚ùå ERROR: "'player_name'"

2. **Frontend Data Display**
   - Player profiles show infinite loading skeletons
   - Game history shows no data
   - Season stats show no data

### üîç Root Cause Analysis

The Python backend appears to have database schema mismatches:
1. It's looking for `player_name` column that doesn't exist
2. It's trying to join `games` with `game_scores` instead of `game_seats`
3. The backend schema expectations don't match the actual database

## Phase 0 Requirements vs Reality

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| PWA Leaderboard | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | UI works, only basic data shown |
| OpenSkill Ratings | ‚úÖ Working | Displayed on leaderboard |
| Player Profiles | ‚ùå Broken | Backend endpoint fails |
| Game History | ‚ùå Broken | Backend endpoint fails |
| Season Stats | ‚ùå Broken | Backend endpoint fails |
| Read-only | ‚úÖ Yes | No write operations |
| Mobile-optimized | ‚úÖ Yes | Responsive design works |
| Supabase connected | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Only leaderboard data flows |

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Existing Tests
- ExpandablePlayerCard: 97% coverage ‚úÖ
- LeaderboardView: 90% coverage ‚úÖ

### Missing Tests
- PlayerProfileView - No tests
- GameHistoryView - No tests
- StatsView - No tests
- API integration tests - None

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Backend Endpoints** (Critical)
   - Update Python backend to match actual database schema
   - Fix player profile endpoint
   - Fix games endpoint
   - Fix season stats endpoint

2. **Add Integration Tests**
   - Test API endpoints actually return expected data
   - Mock API responses for frontend tests
   - Add error handling tests

3. **Complete Frontend Tests**
   - Write tests for PlayerProfileView
   - Write tests for GameHistoryView
   - Write tests for StatsView

## Recommendation

**DO NOT PROCEED** to Phase 0.5 or Phase 1 until:
1. All backend endpoints are fixed and working
2. All Phase 0 pages display real data
3. Test coverage exceeds 80% for all components
4. Manual testing confirms all features work

## Current Status: Phase 0 is INCOMPLETE

The frontend shell exists but without working backend endpoints, the core functionality of Phase 0 (viewing player profiles, game history, and stats) is non-functional.
