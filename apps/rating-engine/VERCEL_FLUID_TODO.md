# Vercel Fluid Configuration for Python Rating Engine
# This will be used when we deploy the Python rating engine

# For future deployment:
# 1. The Python service should be deployable via Vercel Fluid
# 2. We'll need to configure webhooks from Supabase to call the rating function
# 3. Related projects configuration will link web app to rating engine

# Commands for future setup:
# vercel --prod (from rating-engine directory when Fluid is ready)
# Configure webhook URL in Supabase triggers
