# Phase 0 Verification Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### 1. Backend Code Fixes ✅
- [x] Identified all schema mismatches
- [x] Fixed `/players/{id}` endpoint (player_name → display_name)
- [x] Fixed `/games` endpoint (game_scores → game_seats)
- [x] Fixed `/stats/season` endpoint (column name issues)
- [x] Updated code in `/apps/rating-engine/api/index.py`

### 2. Local Testing
- [ ] Run Python backend locally:
  ```bash
  cd apps/rating-engine
  uv sync
  export SUPABASE_URL="..."
  export SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY="..."
  uv run uvicorn rating_engine.main:app --reload
  ```
- [ ] Run test script:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/test_apis.py http://localhost:8000
  ```
- [ ] Verify all 5 endpoints return 200 OK

## Deployment Process

### 1. Deploy Backend
- [ ] Commit changes:
  ```bash
  cd apps/rating-engine
  git add api/index.py
  git commit -m "Fix database schema mismatches in API endpoints

  - Fix player profile: use display_name instead of player_name
  - Fix games: use game_seats instead of game_scores
  - Fix stats: correct column references
  - Add proper error handling"
  git push
  ```
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel:
  ```bash
  vercel --prod
  ```
- [ ] Monitor deployment logs

### 2. Production Verification
- [ ] Run API test script:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/test_apis.py
  ```
- [ ] Expected output:
  ```
  ✅ Health Check         PASS (200 OK)
  ✅ Leaderboard          PASS (200 OK)
  ✅ Player Profile       PASS (200 OK)
  ✅ Games                PASS (200 OK)
