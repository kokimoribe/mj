# ⚙️ Configuration Management System - Status Report

🎯 **Current Status**: **PRODUCTION READY** ✅

## 🚀 System Overview

The configuration management system successfully migrated from legacy service role keys to modern secret key authentication, with full functionality restored.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. YAML Configuration Files

- **configs/season-3.yaml**: Official Season 3 (Feb 2022 - Jul 2025)
- **configs/season-4.yaml**: Future Season 4 (Jul 2025 - Jan 2026)
- **configs/experimental/high-stakes.yaml**: Example experimental config
- **configs/README.md**: Documentation and best practices

### 2. Database Integration

- All configurations loaded into `rating_configurations` table
- Deterministic hashing for version control
- Conflict resolution (upsert on hash)
- Official vs experimental classification

### 3. Configuration Manager Utility

- **scripts/config_manager.py**: Complete management utility
- YAML validation and loading
- Database sync with dry-run support
- Configuration listing and verification

### 4. Current Database State

```
📊 Configurations in database:
  ad7252bd... | Season 3 | 🏆 OFFICIAL
    Official Season 3 - Special carry-over season covering legacy games

  bec5a5c1... | Season 4 | 🏆 OFFICIAL
    Official Season 4 - New system era with web app integration

  aa0a262e... | High Stakes | 🧪 Experimental
    Experimental configuration for high-stakes games with increased volatility
```

## 🎯 Configuration Management Workflow

### Adding New Configurations

1. Create YAML file in `configs/` (seasonal) or `configs/experimental/`
2. Run `uv run python scripts/config_manager.py --load-all --dry-run` to preview
3. Run `uv run python scripts/config_manager.py --load-all` to save

### Validation and Review

- Run `uv run python scripts/config_manager.py --list` to view all configs
- YAML validation ensures required fields are present
- Hash-based versioning prevents configuration drift

### Season Transitions

- Season 3 is currently active and official
- Season 4 is prepared but not yet active
- Transition happens automatically based on timeRange dates

## 🔧 Key Features

### Idempotent Operations

- Safe to re-run configuration loading
- Hash-based conflict resolution
- Preserves existing data on updates

### Version Control

- All configurations stored in Git as YAML
- Deterministic hashing for change detection
- Clear audit trail of configuration changes

### Flexible Classification

- `isOfficial: true/false` for official vs experimental
- Experimental configs don't affect competitive rankings
- Easy promotion from experimental to official

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Documentation Update**: Update docs/05-rating-system.md with actual implementation
2. **Season 4 Activation**: When Season 3 ends (Jul 22, 2025)
3. **Web App Integration**: Load configurations in TypeScript frontend
4. **Configuration UI**: Allow users to create experimental configs via web interface

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
# List all configurations
uv run python scripts/config_manager.py --list

# Load all YAML configs (dry run)
uv run python scripts/config_manager.py --load-all --dry-run

# Load all YAML configs (for real)
uv run python scripts/config_manager.py --load-all

# Sync dependencies (if needed)
uv sync --dev

# Run migration script
uv run python scripts/migrate_legacy_data.py
```
