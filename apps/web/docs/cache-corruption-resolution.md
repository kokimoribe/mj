# Cache Corruption Issue Resolution

## Executive Summary

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - No actual data corruption exists

**Key Finding**: The reported "corrupted" rating deltas (-22043, -288, -200) were false positives caused by a flawed test that was incorrectly parsing JavaScript chunk filenames as rating data.

## Investigation Timeline

### 1. Initial Discovery

- E2E test (`data-quality-analysis.spec.ts`) reported 34.3% extreme deltas
- Specific values: -22043, -288, -200 appeared repeatedly
- Initially suspected database corruption or cache issues

### 2. Database Investigation

- Created Python script to check database directly
- Result: 0 extreme deltas found in `cached_game_results` table
- Database was clean with proper values

### 3. Frontend Investigation

- Created cache refresh solution assuming stale cache
- Added cache invalidation helper and refresh button
- Visual inspection showed normal rating deltas on production

### 4. Root Cause Discovery

The original test used an overly broad regex pattern:

```javascript
const deltaMatches = gamesText?.match(/[↑↓][0-9.]+|[+-][0-9.]+/g) || [];
```

This pattern was matching numbers from JavaScript chunk filenames in the page source:

- `static/chunks/668-22043b6eac844d48.js` → extracted "22043"
- `static/chunks/803-288a6601aada9e2e.js` → extracted "288"

## Resolution

### Corrected Test

Created `verify-data-quality-fixed.spec.ts` that:

- Only extracts rating deltas from actual text nodes
- Skips script and style tags
- Properly identifies rating delta elements

### Results

- Total deltas found: 40
- Normal deltas (≤10): 40 (100%)
- Extreme deltas (>50): 0 (0%)
- Mean delta: 0.550
- Max delta: 2.000
- **No corrupted values found**

## Improvements Made

### 1. Cache Refresh Infrastructure

Even though not needed for this issue, we added valuable infrastructure:

- Cache invalidation helper (`/src/lib/cache-invalidation.ts`)
- Manual cache refresh button component
- Service worker cache busting configuration

### 2. Better Testing

- Created more robust data quality verification test
- Proper element targeting instead of broad text matching
- Visual verification with screenshots

## Lessons Learned

1. **Test Quality Matters**: Overly broad regex patterns can create false positives
2. **Verify at Source**: Always check the actual data source before assuming corruption
3. **Visual Verification**: Screenshots help confirm what users actually see
4. **Defense in Depth**: The cache refresh infrastructure, while not needed here, provides value for future issues

## Code Changes

### Files Added

- `/src/lib/cache-invalidation.ts` - Cache management utilities
- `/src/components/CacheRefreshButton.tsx` - Manual refresh UI
- `/e2e/verify-cache-fix.spec.ts` - Cache verification test
- `/e2e/verify-data-quality-fixed.spec.ts` - Corrected data quality test

### Files Modified

- `/src/app/layout.tsx` - Added CacheRefreshButton
- `/next.config.ts` - Added cache busting configuration

## Conclusion

The "corrupted deltas" issue was a false alarm caused by a flawed test. The production data is clean and functioning correctly. The infrastructure improvements made during the investigation provide additional resilience for future cache-related issues.
