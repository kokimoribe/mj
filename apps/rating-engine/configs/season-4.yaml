# Season 4 Configuration (DEPRECATED - Use season-4-v2.yaml instead)
#
# ⚠️  This configuration has been superseded by `season-4-v2.yaml`
#
# Why was this replaced?
# - This original config used an endDate of 2025-12-31
# - Season 5 officially starts on 2025-12-28 (games have already been played and recorded)
# - Keeping Season 4 open through 12/31 would allow 12/28–12/31 games to be counted in BOTH
#   Season 4 and Season 5 (overlapping time ranges) if both configs are materialized
#
# The corrected version (`season-4-v2.yaml`) closes Season 4 on 2025-12-24 to provide a
# cushion between the last Season 4 game and the first Season 5 game, avoiding overlap.
#
# Important: time filtering is done using `games.started_at` in UTC.
# The web UI may render those timestamps in local time, but materialization uses UTC ranges.
#
# This file is kept for historical reference only. Do not use for new materializations.
