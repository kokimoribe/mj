# Vercel Protection Bypass Troubleshooting Log

## Issue Analysis
The deployment is protected by **Vercel Authentication (SSO)**, not just deployment protection. The HTML shows:
- `class="sso-enabled"` 
- Redirect to `vercel.com/sso-api`
- Footer shows "Vercel Authentication"

## Current Status
- **Protection Type**: Vercel Authentication (SSO) - requires user login
- **Bypass Secret**: `x7uAxRZn82x8WG0HodCp4UzXqcf6EMf4`
- **Expected Behavior**: Should bypass authentication per docs
- **Actual Behavior**: Still shows authentication page

## What I've Tried

### 1. Header Approach
```bash
curl -H "x-vercel-protection-bypass: x7uAxRZn82x8WG0HodCp4UzXqcf6EMf4" URL
```
**Result**: Returns authentication page

### 2. Query Parameter Approach  
```bash
curl "URL?x-vercel-protection-bypass=x7uAxRZn82x8WG0HodCp4UzXqcf6EMf4"
```
**Result**: "NOT_FOUND" (different error - progress!)

### 3. Additional Headers
```bash
curl -H "x-vercel-protection-bypass: SECRET" -H "x-vercel-set-bypass-cookie: true" URL
```
**Result**: Still authentication page

## Key Findings

1. **Query parameter method** gave different error ("NOT_FOUND" vs auth page)
2. **This is Vercel Authentication**, not deployment protection
3. **Documentation says** bypass should work for Vercel Authentication
4. **Secret appears correct** from dashboard

## Remaining Theories

1. **Secret timing**: Maybe bypass only works on deployments created AFTER secret was set
2. **Environment mismatch**: Maybe secret is only for specific environments
3. **Rate limiting**: Maybe too many failed attempts triggered protection
4. **API vs Web**: Maybe bypass works for API calls but not web requests
5. **Header casing**: Maybe header name needs different casing
6. **Content-Type**: Maybe need to specify content type for bypass

## Next Experiments

1. Test on a fresh deployment
2. Try different header casing
3. Test with explicit content-type
4. Try with POST request
5. Check if secret works with API endpoints vs root path
