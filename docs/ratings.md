# Mahjong Rating System Formula - Complete Guide

## Overview

This mahjong rating system uses the **OpenSkill Plackett-Luce model** to calculate player skill ratings. It tracks two values for each player:

- **μ (mu)**: Skill estimate
- **σ (sigma)**: Uncertainty about the skill estimate

After each game, these values are updated using sophisticated Bayesian mathematics. The **display rating** shown to users is a conservative estimate calculated as `μ - 2σ`.

## How It Actually Works (High Level)

### **The Plackett-Luce Model**

Based on research from Wikipedia and your implementation, the system uses the Plackett-Luce model, which:

1. **Models Rankings**: Unlike simple win/loss systems, it handles 4-player rankings (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)
2. **Accounts for Strength**: Each player has a "strength" value that determines win probability
3. **Updates Bayesian**: Uses complex probability math to update skill estimates after each game
4. **Includes Margin of Victory**: Your system adds weights based on plus-minus scores

### **Core Formula (What You See)**

```
Display Rating = μ - (2.0 × σ)
```

**Starting Values:**

- **μ**: 25.0 (skill estimate)
- **σ**: 8.33 (uncertainty, which is 25÷3)
- **Display Rating**: 25.0 - (2.0 × 8.33) = **8.34**

## What You Can Calculate By Hand

### **Step 1: Plus-Minus Calculation** ✓ (Exact)

This is the only part that's truly manual-friendly:

```
Plus-Minus = (Final Score - 20,000) + Uma Bonus
```

**Uma Bonuses:**

- 1st place: +10,000
- 2nd place: +5,000
- 3rd place: -5,000
- 4th place: -10,000

**Example:**

- Player finishes 1st with 35,000 points
- Plus-Minus = (35,000 - 20,000) + 10,000 = **25,000**

### **Step 2: Performance Weight** ✓ (Exact)

```
Weight = 1.0 + (Plus-Minus ÷ 40)
Weight = max(0.5, min(1.5, Weight))  // Capped between 0.5-1.5
```

**Example:**

- Plus-Minus = 25,000
- Weight = 1.0 + (25,000 ÷ 40) = 1.0 + 625 = 626 → **capped at 1.5**

### **Step 3: Current Display Rating** ✓ (Exact)

```
Display Rating = μ - (2.0 × σ)
```

## What Requires Advanced Math (Not Manual)

### **The Real Rating Update Process**

Based on the Plackett-Luce model research and your code, here's what actually happens:

1. **Strength Calculation**: Each player's current μ and σ are converted to a "strength" value
2. **Expected Rankings**: The system calculates what ranking was expected based on all players' strengths
3. **Likelihood Computation**: Complex probability calculations determine how likely the actual result was
4. **Bayesian Update**: μ and σ are updated using factor graphs, expectation propagation, and moment matching
5. **Weight Application**: Your margin-of-victory weights amplify the rating changes

### **The Mathematical Reality**

According to Wikipedia, the Plackett-Luce model for 4 players uses:

```
Pr(ranking) = ∏(player_strength / sum_of_remaining_strengths)
```

This requires iterative algorithms to solve, not simple arithmetic.

## Practical Example - What You Can Do

Let's work through a realistic example where you CAN calculate some parts:

### **Game Setup**

- **Alice**: μ=25.0, σ=8.33, Display=8.34 (new player)
- **Bob**: μ=27.2, σ=4.1, Display=19.0 (experienced)
- **Carol**: μ=22.8, σ=5.2, Display=12.4 (intermediate)
- **David**: μ=24.1, σ=6.0, Display=12.1 (intermediate)

### **Game Result**

- Alice: 1st, 38,000 points → Plus-minus: +28,000, Weight: 1.5
- Bob: 2nd, 28,000 points → Plus-minus: +13,000, Weight: 1.5
- Carol: 3rd, 18,000 points → Plus-minus: -7,000, Weight: 0.5
- David: 4th, 16,000 points → Plus-minus: -14,000, Weight: 0.5

### **What You Can Predict (Conceptually)**

- **Alice** (high σ, big win): Huge rating increase expected
- **Bob** (low σ, slight underperform): Small rating decrease expected
- **Carol** (performed as expected): Minimal change expected
- **David** (underperformed): Moderate decrease expected

### **What You Cannot Calculate**

- The exact new μ and σ values (requires OpenSkill algorithm)
- How much uncertainty decreases for each player
- The precise new display ratings

## Key Insights

1. **Alice's rating jump**: New players (high σ) see dramatic rating changes because the system is still learning their skill level
2. **Exact calculations require advanced math**: The OpenSkill algorithm uses Bayesian inference that cannot be easily calculated by hand
3. **Weight impact**: Bigger score margins create larger rating changes through the weight system
4. **Uncertainty always decreases**: Everyone's σ decreases after each game, making future ratings more stable

## Summary for Manual Understanding

### **What You CAN Calculate Manually:**

1. **Plus-minus scores**: `(final_score - 20,000) + uma_bonus` ✓
2. **Performance weights**: `1.0 + (plus_minus ÷ 40)` capped 0.5-1.5 ✓
3. **Current display rating**: `μ - (2.0 × σ)` ✓

### **What Requires OpenSkill Library:**

1. **Expected performance calculations** (complex Bayesian math)
2. **μ and σ updates** (factor graphs and expectation propagation)
3. **Precise rating changes** (moment matching algorithms)

### **Practical Approach:**

For actual rating calculations, use the existing system:

```python
# From your materialization.py
new_ratings = openskill_model.rate(teams, ranks, weights=weights)
```

The value of understanding these concepts is to:

- **Tune parameters** (uma bonuses, weight scaling, confidence factor)
- **Debug unexpected results** (why did ratings change more/less than expected?)
- **Explain the system** to players and stakeholders
- **Design alternative scoring** systems if needed

The core insight is that **OpenSkill compares expected vs actual performance** and adjusts ratings accordingly, with bigger adjustments for:

- Players with high uncertainty (σ)
- Surprising results (high weight from score margins)
- Consistent patterns over multiple games

## Key Takeaways for Different Audiences

### **For Laypeople**

- **Simple Concept**: Win big games = rating goes up more, lose badly = rating goes down more
- **What You Can Track**: Plus-minus scores and performance weights after each game
- **Bottom Line**: The computer does complex math, but the basic idea is "better results = higher rating"

### **For Stakeholders**

- **Manual Calculation**: Only plus-minus and weights can be calculated by hand
- **The Real Work**: OpenSkill algorithm handles the complex Bayesian mathematics
- **Validation**: System is mathematically sound, based on established Plackett-Luce model

### **For Developers**

- **Implementation**: Use `openskill_model.rate(teams, ranks, weights)`
