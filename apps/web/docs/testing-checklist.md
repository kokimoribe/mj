## Critical Issues Found

### ðŸ”´ High Priority
1. **No Database Integration** - All features use mock data
2. **No Data Persistence** - Nothing is saved between sessions
3. **No Tests** - Zero frontend test coverage
4. **API Endpoints Missing** - Frontend has no way to save data
5. **Offline Support Missing** - Despite being in requirements

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority
1. **Form Validation** - Some inputs accept invalid data
2. **Error Handling** - No user feedback on failures
3. **Loading States** - No loading indicators
4. **Empty States** - Poor UX when no data exists

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority
1. **Animations** - Transitions could be smoother
2. **Accessibility** - Missing ARIA labels
3. **PWA Features** - Offline mode, push notifications
4. **Performance** - Some components re-render unnecessarily

## Recommendation

**DO NOT PROCEED TO PHASE 3** until critical issues are resolved:

1. Set up frontend testing framework (Jest/Vitest + React Testing Library)
2. Create API integration layer with Supabase
3. Implement data persistence for all features
4. Write tests for critical user flows
5. Add error handling and loading states
6. Perform another bug bash after fixes

## Test Environment Setup

To properly test:
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run the rating engine
cd ../../apps/rating-engine
npm run dev

# Check that Supabase is configured
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```
