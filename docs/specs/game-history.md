# Game History

## Overview

The Game History page provides a chronological view of all games played in the current season (i.e. the default config) of the Riichi Mahjong League. It displays game results with scores, placements, and rating impacts, allowing players to review past games and track season progression. The page supports filtering and pagination for easy navigation through the season's games.

### Component Hierarchy

- `GameHistoryView` - Main container
  - `PageHeader` - Title and game count
  - `FilterControls` - Filtering options
    - `PlayerFilter` - Dropdown to filter by player
    - `DateRangeFilter` - Date range selector (Phase 1)
  - `GamesList` - Scrollable list of games
    - `GameCard` - Individual game result
      - `GameHeader` - Date and time
      - `PlayerResults` - 4 player results
        - `PlayerResult` - Individual result line
  - `LoadMoreButton` - Pagination control (toggles to ShowLessButton)

### Interaction Patterns

1. **Filtering**
   - Dropdown shows all players + "All Games" option
   - Selecting player shows only their games
   - Filter persists during session
   - Clear filter returns to all games

2. **Game Cards**
   - Compact view shows essential information
   - Consistent layout for easy scanning
   - Visual hierarchy with placement medals
   - Tap entire card for details (Phase 1)

3. **Pagination (Show/Hide Toggle)**
   - Load 10 games initially
   - "Load More Games" reveals 10 additional games (already loaded)
   - Button changes to "Show Less Games" after expansion
   - "Show Less Games" hides the additional games (back to initial 10)
   - All game data loaded initially for simple client-side show/hide
   - Smooth transitions between states

### Game Card Layout

```
Each game card contains:
- Date/time header
- 4 player rows with:
  - Placement icon (🥇🥈🥉4️⃣)
  - Player name
  - Final table score (e.g., 42,700)
  - Rating change (↑/↓ with value)
```

### Score Display Format

```
Display only the final table score:
- 1st: 42,700 pts
- 2nd: 31,200 pts
- 3rd: 11,800 pts
- 4th: 14,300 pts

Note: Uma/Oka calculations are internal implementation details
used for rating calculations and should NOT be displayed to users.
```

### Rating Change Display

```
Show the actual rating change for each player:
↑0.8 (rating increased by 0.8 points)
↓1.2 (rating decreased by 1.2 points)
— (no change or first game)

Rating changes should reflect the actual OpenSkill rating
difference, not score adjustments.
```

### Date Format

```
Use a simple, consistent format:
"Jul 6, 2025 • 7:46 PM" (or similar readable format)
Browser's default locale is acceptable (all users are in same timezone)
```

## Technical Requirements

### Data Model

```typescript
interface GameResult {
  playerId: string;
  playerName: string;
  placement: number; // 1-4
  rawScore: number; // Final table score
  scoreAdjustment: number; // Plus/minus with uma/oka
  ratingBefore: number;
  ratingAfter: number;
  ratingChange: number;
}

interface Game {
  id: string;
  date: string; // ISO 8601 format
  seasonId: string;
  results: GameResult[]; // Always 4 players
}

interface GameHistoryData {
  games: Game[];
  totalGames: number;
  hasMore: boolean;
  nextCursor?: string;
  showingAll: boolean; // Track if showing all loaded games or just initial 10
}

interface FilterOptions {
  playerId?: string; // undefined = all games
  dateFrom?: string;
  dateTo?: string;
}
```

### Configuration

```typescript
// Default season config hash (hardcoded for Season 3)
// Must match configuration used in leaderboard and player profile features
const DEFAULT_SEASON_CONFIG_HASH = "season_3_2024";
const currentSeasonConfigHash = DEFAULT_SEASON_CONFIG_HASH;
```

### Supabase Queries

```typescript
// Get paginated game history
const { data: games, count } = await supabase
  .from("games")
  .select(
    `
    id,
    finished_at,
    game_seats!inner(
      seat,
      player_id,
      final_score,
      players!inner(
        id,
        name
      )
    ),
    cached_game_results!inner(
      player_id,
      placement,
      raw_score,
      score_delta,
      rating_before,
      rating_after,
      rating_change
    )
  `,
    { count: "exact" }
  )
  .eq("status", "finished")
  .eq("cached_game_results.config_hash", currentSeasonConfigHash)
  .order("finished_at", { ascending: false })
  .range(offset, offset + limit - 1);

// Filter by player (when filter is active)
const { data: playerGames } = await supabase
  .from("game_seats")
  .select(
    `
    game_id,
    games!inner(
      id,
      finished_at,
      status
    )
  `
  )
  .eq("player_id", playerId)
  .eq("games.status", "finished")
  .order("games.finished_at", { ascending: false })
  .range(offset, offset + limit - 1);

// Then fetch full game details for filtered games
const gameIds = playerGames.map(g => g.game_id);
const { data: filteredGames } = await supabase
  .from("games")
  .select(/* same select as above */)
  .in("id", gameIds);

// Get all players for the filter dropdown
const { data: allPlayers } = await supabase
  .from("players")
  .select("id, name")
  .order("name", { ascending: true });
```

## Test Scenarios

1. **View All Games**
   - Given: Season has games played
   - When: User navigates to Games tab
   - Then: Shows 10 most recent games

2. **Load More Games**
   - Given: More than 10 games exist
   - When: User taps "Load More Games"
   - Then: 10 additional games append to list
   - And: Button changes to "Show Less Games"

2a. **Show Less Games**

- Given: User has loaded additional games
- When: User taps "Show Less Games"
- Then: Additional games are hidden
- And: Button changes back to "Load More Games"

3. **Filter by Player**
   - Given: Games list is displayed
   - When: User selects player from dropdown
   - Then: Only games with that player show

4. **Clear Filter**
   - Given: Player filter is active
   - When: User selects "All Games"
   - Then: All games show again

5. **Game Result Display**
   - Given: A game is displayed
   - When: Viewing the game card
   - Then: Shows all 4 players in placement order

6. **Score Formatting**
   - Given: Game has final scores
   - When: Displaying scores
   - Then: Numbers format with commas (31,100)

7. **Rating Changes**
   - Given: Game caused rating changes
   - When: Viewing results
   - Then: Shows ↑/↓ with change amount

8. **Empty State**
   - Given: No games match filter
   - When: Filter is applied
   - Then: Shows "No games found" message

## Edge Cases

1. **No Games**: Show "No games played yet" message
2. **Single Game**: Still shows in list format
3. **Long Names**: Truncate with ellipsis
4. **Large Scores**: Format with commas (100,000)
5. **Negative Scores**: Display with minus sign
6. **Zero Rating Change**: Show "—" instead of ↑/↓
7. **Missing Player**: Show placeholder name
8. **Same Timestamp**: Secondary sort by game ID

## Filter Behavior

### Player Filter Rules

1. **Default State**: "All Games" selected
2. **Player List**: Show all players from the database (including those with 0 games)
3. **Player Option Format**: "PlayerName (X games)"
4. **Sort Order**: By game count descending
5. **Persistence**: Remember during session
6. **URL State**: Update URL for shareable links

### Future Filters (Phase 1)

- Date range picker
- Placement filter (show only 1st place games)
- Score threshold filter
- Multi-player filter

## Mobile Considerations

1. **Responsive Layout**:
   - Single column on mobile
   - Full width game cards
   - Appropriate font sizes

2. **Touch Optimization**:
   - Large tap targets for filters
   - Swipe to refresh (optional)
   - Smooth scrolling

3. **Performance**:
   - Lazy load images (if added)
   - Efficient re-renders
   - Minimal layout shifts

## Mobile iOS vs Desktop Chrome Strategy

**Approach**: Consistent UI with platform-appropriate interactions.

**Mobile (iOS, <768px)**:

- Touch-sized filter controls (44x44px minimum)
- Dropdown filter with native select on iOS
- Pull-to-refresh support
- Bottom navigation visible
- Smooth momentum scrolling

**Desktop (Chrome, ≥768px)**:

- Same layout structure (single column)
- Hover states on game cards
- Keyboard navigation support
- Bottom navigation remains (functional parity)
- Standard scrolling behavior

**Benefits**:

- Single component structure
- CSS handles responsive differences
- Functional parity maintained
- Simple, maintainable codebase

## Accessibility Requirements

- **Screen Reader Support**:
  - Announce game results clearly
  - Read placement, name, scores in order
  - Indicate filtered state

- **Keyboard Navigation**:
  - Tab through filters and games
  - Enter to activate controls
  - Focus management on load more

- **Visual Design**:
  - Don't rely only on emoji for placement
  - Sufficient color contrast
  - Clear visual hierarchy

- **Loading States**:
  - Announce when loading
  - Indicate completion
  - Error messages if failure
